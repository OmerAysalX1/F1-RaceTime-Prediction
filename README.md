🎯 Project Purpose
🏎️ Developing a machine learning model that predicts finish time in Formula 1 races.
With this project:
✅ Race strategies can be developed.
✅ Performance analyzes of teams and drivers can be made. ✅ More reliable predictions can be produced for the betting industry. ✅ Future race scenarios can be tested.

# 🔥 Why is it important?

🔹 Realistic Simulations: The model can predict race results by taking into account variables such as different position order, fastest lap time and how many laps the race will last.

🔹 Competitive Advantage: Teams can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents.

🔹 Betting and Data Analytics: It can increase reliability by providing more accurate predictions in the legal betting industry.

# 📊 Dataset Used
A comprehensive dataset of Formula 1 races was used in this project.

| Filename | Description | Number of Lines |
|------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| results.csv | Race results | 26,519 |
| races.csv | Race dates & track information | 1,125 |
| drivers.csv | Driver information | 1,125 |
| constructors.csv | Team information | 212 |

The dataset was processed using scikit-learn and pandas, cleaning missing data and merging different files using appropriate columns.

# 📈 Modeling Steps
Data Visualization: Relationships between race time and other variables were examined.
Feature Selection:</br>
• Mutual Information</br>
• Random Forest Feature Importance</br>
Scaling: Variables were scaled using Min-Max Scaler.</br>
Transformations: Categorical data was fitted to the model with get_dummies(). 
# 📌 Machine Learning Models:

• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression</br>
